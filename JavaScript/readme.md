# How to run the scripts

## Install Node.js

[Nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)

## From Command line

Navigate to the folder your script is located. You can use `ls` to list Folders and Files, and `cd` to change directory.
After you are in the correct folder, type `node .` or `node [filename]`.
**Example:** `node variables.js`

If you do not want to navigate folders, you can just simply type the full filepath to your script, `node [filepath/filename]`.
**Example:** `node JavaScript/variables.js`

## From Browsers

Alternatively you can run your scripts in the browser, using a html file that includes your script. Just drop your html file in your favorite browser and open developer tools, check the console tab to see the results.
